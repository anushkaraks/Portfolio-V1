# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, designed and built to showcase my work, skills, and background in a clean and interactive way. I focused on combining strong visuals with smooth interactions to create a portfolio that feels personal, modern, and easy to navigate. The site also includes a custom animated intro screen to make the first impression unique.

# Features

A custom envelope animation that opens to reveal the website. It adds personality and sets the tone before the user enters the main content.

## Landing Section

Introduces me with a clear heading, short description, role tags, skill badges, and call-to-action buttons for quick interaction.

## Highlighted Projects

A carousel section where I display some of my key projects with images, descriptions, and buttons for more details.

## More Projects

A categorized list of additional Java, Web, and College projects. Each project is shown with a mini-card layout for quick reading.

## About & Fun Facts

A notebook-style layout where I talk about myself, my interests, and a small fun fact—presented in a friendly and readable format.

## Contact Section

A business-card-inspired section with my email, location, and a link to download my resume.
